# Election_Analysis
Python Module 3 repository

## Overview of Project
The objective of this project was to analyze election votes and determine election results by candidate and county.  Election votes were 
provided in a comma delimited text file with three columns, Ballot ID, County and Candidates.   There were 3 counties where votes were 
recorded.  Voters had 3 candidates to choose from.  The winning would be the person who received the most amount of votes across all 3
counties.  The project also wanted analysis on voter turnout across all 3 counties, which one had the highest voter turnout and breakdown
of the percentage of total turnout by county.

### Purpose

The project challenge was looking for election results to be presented on the terminal as well as in a text file.  The program was
written in Python using 2 dependencies (os and csv) that allowed the program to open / read / write to text files.  We used lists to 
record counties and candidates and dictionaries to hold the number of votes by county and candidates.

F strings were used to format results both on the terminal and in the output file.
